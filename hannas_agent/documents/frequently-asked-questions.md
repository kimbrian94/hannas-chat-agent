## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should I contact you after giving birth?
Our Hanna’s Mom’s Care team begins preparing about one week before your due date. Please contact us when you are heading to the hospital for delivery via text message, email, or phone.

📌 Please note:
- Phone calls may not always be answered immediately due to ongoing work.
- Leaving a message will allow us to respond as soon as possible.
- After delivery, please also confirm your hospital discharge date with us.
- Because due dates often change, it is very important that you notify us when you go to the hospital. 😊

### What if I give birth earlier than my due date?
Due dates are rarely the same as the actual delivery dates. The due date is used as a reference only. A preliminary caregiver assignment is made close to delivery, and final caregiver assignment begins once delivery details are confirmed. If there are any changes to your due date or important updates before the service begins, please contact us anytime by email.

### What if my home address changes before service starts?
If the new address is within a similar distance to the original contracted location, simply notify us via your consultation platform before service begins.

If the new address is more than approximately 50 minutes farther by car, please notify us at least 30 days before the expected service start date.

⚠️ If we are not notified in advance and the service begins at a significantly farther location, the originally assigned caregiver may not be able to serve the area, and additional fuel charges may apply.

### Can I claim this service as a tax deduction?
This question has been asked by many families over the past 10+ years. Some clients have been able to claim deductions during tax season, while others have not. This depends on individual circumstances and should be discussed with your accountant or tax professional.

At this time, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) generally recognizes only specific medical services as deductible. Postpartum care is not typically classified as a medical service, so it may not qualify as a medical expense deduction.

If needed, we can issue an invoice labeled as Child Care upon request.

### Can I interview and select the doulas I want to work with?
Due to fluctuating delivery date changes and different client needs, we can provide more concrete details about doulas closer to your due date, usually 1-2 days before the service start date. However, if there is some dissatisfaction about the service, we will help accommodate and ultimately find another doula for you.

### I don’t speak Korean. Would this be an issue?
We have been and are currently serving clients from diverse cultural backgrounds. Although our doulas may not have native proficiency in English, we will assign doulas who can communicate in English.

### Do you have fixed meal plans specific for postpartum?
The answer is, no. There are nutrients and food items that are recommended for postpartum recovery, however, it will depend on each individual’s health condition and preference. After your booking is finalized with us, we send you the sample nutrition guide with sample meal plans and grocery shopping list. We do recommend seaweed soup and include this in your meal at least once a day!

### What should I prepare for the doula’s first day?
You are not required to prepare anything! But if you like to plan ahead, we send you sample meal plans and a sample ingredient shopping list, so you can stock before the service starts. If you are unsure, you can request grocery shopping to your doula!


### Can I have RMT (Registered Massage Therapy) and Facial Massage together?
No, you cannot have both RMT massage and Facial Massage together. Special Facial Massage is only available as an add-on to the Special Full-Body Massage (non-RMT). You cannot receive facial massage as a standalone service or in combination with RMT massage. Receiving the Special Full-Body Massage is a pre-requisite for the facial massage add-on.

### Can I get the Special Facial Massage by itself?
No, the Special Facial Massage cannot be booked as a standalone service. It is only available as an add-on when you receive the Special Full-Body Massage (non-RMT).

### Can I add the Special Facial Massage to RMT massage?
No, the Special Facial Massage add-on is not available with RMT massage. It is exclusively an add-on to the Special Full-Body Massage (non-RMT).

### What should I prepare for the first day of postpartum care?
You don’t need to prepare anything at all!

If you would like to prepare in advance, we can provide a sample meal plan and basic grocery list so you can shop ahead of time. If you’re unsure what to prepare, you may also request that the caregiver handles grocery shopping.

Before the service begins, your caregiver will contact you directly to coordinate details such as:
- Start time
- Grocery list
- Allergies
- Any important preferences or considerations

### Are caregivers vaccinated?
Yes. All Hanna’s Mom’s Care caregivers complete the required vaccinations mandated by the Canadian government before beginning service, including:
- Tdap
- Td
- MMR
- Hepatitis B

### Are caregivers certified in CPR / First Aid?
At this time, our doulas are not certified in Infant CPR & First Aid. We want to be transparent so you can make the decision that feels best for your family.

If CPR & First Aid certification is something that causes ongoing concern, we completely understand. We also want you to begin postpartum care feeling calm and confident, not anxious or uncertain.

### Are caregivers certified doulas?
Hanna’s Mom’s Care provides in-house training for all caregivers. Only those who complete both classroom training and on-site training are eligible to begin providing services.

### Do caregivers provide breast massage?
Our caregivers are not licensed massage therapists, so they do not provide breast massage or similar treatments.

However, they do offer warm steam towel care for the chest and abdomen.
Hanna’s Mom’s Care also offers separate massage packages. If you are interested in massage services, please refer to our service guidelines. 🙂

### What if I’m not comfortable with my caregiver and want to stop the service?
Postpartum care is very personal. Even highly experienced caregivers may be a great match for some mothers and not for others.

If there are specific preferences or concerns you’d like us to consider, we’ll take those into account when assigning your caregiver. If you still feel uncomfortable after the service begins, we can reassign a different caregiver.

Please feel free to speak openly with our management team.
We understand how meaningful this time is for you, and we will do our very best to support you during this important period.

### Do I really need a Night Nurse?
Caring for your baby is important—but proper rest for the mother is essential for recovery.

Nighttime feedings and care can significantly disrupt sleep and slow postpartum healing. Accepting help is not a sign of weakness—it is a choice to prioritize recovery.

Our Night Nurse service takes care of the night so you can rest.

### What does a Night Nurse do?
**Newborn care:**
- Monitor the baby’s sleep throughout the night
- Feeding (breast, formula, or mixed): bottle feeding and burping
- Diaper changes
- Soothing and putting baby back to sleep (swaddling, calming)
- Care for spit-up or reflux

This allows the mother to get continuous sleep and proper rest.

**Maternal support:**
- Putting the baby back to sleep after nighttime feedings
- For breastfeeding mothers: bringing the baby for feeding and returning them afterward
- Light cleanup of feeding tools (bottle washing and sterilizing)

### Can I extend the service later?
Because Hanna’s Mom’s Care operates on a reservation system and delivery dates are unpredictable, it can be very difficult to adjust schedules once the service has started.

We recommend carefully considering your needs and selecting the number of weeks at the time of contract. Many mothers later wish they had booked a longer duration.

### Can I shorten the service later?
If you notify us at least 30 days before the service start date, we can adjust the service duration by up to one week at no additional cost.

### What is the minimum length of service?
The minimum service duration is one week, consisting of 5 or 6 service days.

### How far in advance should I book?
Due to high demand, we recommend booking as early as possible. 🙂

Many mothers reach out once they pass the stable stage of pregnancy (around 14 weeks / 4 months).

### Are massage services provided at home?
Yes. All of our massage services are in-home visits, provided at the mother’s residence.

### Do I need to prepare anything before the massage?
The massage team will bring all necessary equipment, including the massage bed and oils. Before the service begins, the massage team will let you know if there is anything you need to prepare in advance.

### What is the difference between the Special Postpartum Massage and RMT massage?
Hanna’s Special Full-Body Massage is based on traditional Korean meridian (acupressure) massage, which is a different discipline from RMT massage.

The Special Full-Body Massage is personally provided by Team Lead - Hanna Kim. She holds a Toronto City–certified Holistic Practitioner license.

### Can I extend the massage service later?
Because Hanna’s services are reservation-based and due dates are unpredictable, it is very difficult to adjust schedules once services have started.

We recommend deciding on the desired number of sessions at the time of booking. Many clients later wish they had booked more sessions in advance.

### Can I reduce the number of massage sessions later?
If you shorten the number of postpartum massage sessions, any multi-session discount previously applied will be canceled.

### Do you offer prenatal massage?
Yes, we offer prenatal massage.
- Available after 36 weeks of pregnancy
- Pricing and session length are the same as postpartum massage

### What are the RMT massage prices?
The pricing for RMT massage and Special Full-Body Massage is the same. However, RMT appointments must be booked directly through the RMT manager.

RMT managers vary by location:
- Areas: Vaughan, Maple, North York, Scarborough
  📞 647-564-7117
  Leah – RMT Manager
- Areas: Mississauga, Etobicoke, Oakville
  📞 647-568-7991

For all other areas, please contact the Hanna’s Mom’s Care management team. 🙂

**1–3 weeks of service**

**4–8 weeks of service**
→ Deposit = 50% of the total service cost
→ Maximum deposit: 4 weeks of service
