## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I deliver earlier than the original due date?
Due dates are rarely the same as the actual delivery dates. We take due dates just as a reference, but we will have potential doulas on standby close to your due date and officially start arranging once the delivery details are finalized.

### Can I interview and select the doulas I want to work with?
Due to fluctuating delivery date changes and different client needs, we can provide more concrete details about doulas closer to your due date, usually 1-2 days before the service start date. However, if there is some dissatisfaction about the service, we will help accommodate and ultimately find another doula for you.

### I don’t speak Korean. Would this be an issue?
We have been and are currently serving clients from diverse cultural backgrounds. Although our doulas may not have native proficiency in English, we will assign doulas who can communicate in English.

### Do you have fixed meal plans specific for postpartum?
The answer is, no. There are nutrients and food items that are recommended for postpartum recovery, however, it will depend on each individual’s health condition and preference. After your booking is finalized with us, we send you the sample nutrition guide with sample meal plans and grocery shopping list. We do recommend seaweed soup and include this in your meal at least once a day!

### What should I prepare for the doula’s first day?
You are not required to prepare anything! But if you like to plan ahead, we send you sample meal plans and a sample ingredient shopping list, so you can stock before the service starts. If you are unsure, you can request grocery shopping to your doula!
