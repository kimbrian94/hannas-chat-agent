# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## General Questions

### Q: What exactly is postpartum care?
**A:** Postpartum care refers to professional support provided to new mothers and families after childbirth. This includes help with newborn care, breastfeeding, physical recovery, emotional support, household tasks, and parent education. Our services fill the gap between hospital discharge and becoming confident parents.

### Q: When should I book services?
**A:** We recommend booking during your second or third trimester (around 20-32 weeks pregnant) to ensure availability. However, we also accept last-minute bookings based on availability and often can accommodate families within 24-48 hours after birth.

### Q: What if my baby arrives early or late?
**A:** We maintain flexible scheduling. Your start date can be adjusted without penalty as long as you notify us. We understand babies come on their own timeline!

### Q: What are your service areas?
**A:** We serve the Greater Seattle area including Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, Issaquah, Mercer Island, Sammamish, Bothell, and Renton. Extended service areas (within 50 miles) available with additional travel fee.

### Q: Do you offer services in Korean?
**A:** Yes! We have bilingual English/Korean speaking doulas, lactation consultants, and care coordinators. Please request language preference when booking.

### Q: Are your staff background checked?
**A:** Absolutely. All our caregivers undergo comprehensive background checks, reference verification, and are fully insured. We prioritize your family's safety and security.

## Postpartum Doula Questions

### Q: What's the difference between a postpartum doula and a baby nurse?
**A:** Postpartum doulas focus on the whole family - supporting mother's recovery, teaching baby care skills, and helping with household tasks. They empower parents to feel confident. Baby nurses (Newborn Care Specialists) focus primarily on the baby's care, often providing overnight support. We offer both types of professionals.

### Q: Can I request a specific doula?
**A:** Yes! We do our best to match you with a doula based on your preferences, needs, and their availability. You can request someone specific or meet potential doulas before committing.

### Q: What if I don't connect with my assigned doula?
**A:** While rare, we understand chemistry matters. If you're not comfortable with your doula, let us know immediately and we'll arrange a replacement at no charge.

### Q: Do doulas help with twins or multiples?
**A:** Yes! We have doulas specially trained in multiples care. They're experienced with tandem feeding, managing multiple schedules, and the unique challenges of caring for more than one newborn.

### Q: Will my doula clean my entire house?
**A:** Doulas provide light housekeeping focused on areas that impact your immediate wellbeing - kitchen cleanup, baby laundry, tidying common areas. They're not housekeepers, but they ensure your environment supports rest and recovery.

### Q: Can my doula come while my partner is home?
**A:** Absolutely! Many families benefit from having support even when partners are present. Your doula can teach both parents, allow partners to rest too, or handle household tasks while parents bond with baby.

### Q: What if I want to cancel or reschedule a visit?
**A:** Please provide 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling. Last-minute cancellations (less than 24 hours) may be charged at 50% rate. We understand emergencies happen and handle them case-by-case.

## Lactation Questions

### Q: Does insurance cover lactation consultations?
**A:** Many insurance plans cover lactation services under the Affordable Care Act. We provide superbills and documentation for reimbursement. Check with your insurance about coverage.

### Q: What should I do to prepare for a lactation visit?
**A:** Have baby ready to feed (not recently fed), wear comfortable clothing with easy breast access, have a pen and paper for notes, and prepare any questions you have. Don't stress about tidying up - we're there to help you, not judge your housekeeping!

### Q: Can I do a lactation consultation via video?
**A:** Yes! Virtual consultations are very effective for many issues. We can observe positioning, latch, and provide guidance remotely. Some situations (weight checks, physical breast exam) require in-person visits.

### Q: How quickly can I get a lactation appointment?
**A:** We typically can schedule within 24-48 hours. For urgent situations (suspected mastitis, severe pain, baby not feeding), we offer same-day appointments when possible, including weekends.

### Q: My baby is bottle-fed. Can you still help?
**A:** Absolutely! We support all feeding methods including exclusive pumping, formula feeding, and combination feeding. Lactation consultants can help with bottle feeding technique, paced feeding, and transitioning between breast and bottle.

### Q: Can you help if I want to stop breastfeeding?
**A:** Yes, we support whatever feeding decision works for your family. We can help with gentle weaning, managing discomfort, and ensuring baby transitions well to bottles.

**A:** We want you to love everything! If you don't enjoy something, let us know and we'll replace it with something else or credit your account. Customer satisfaction is our priority.

### Q: How are meals packaged and delivered?
**A:** Meals come in microwave and oven-safe containers with reheating instructions. Fresh deliveries arrive in insulated coolers. You keep the containers (no returns needed). Packaging is recyclable.

**A:** Absolutely! Many families order extra portions for partners, older children, or visiting family. Family-style portions available.

### Q: What's special about postpartum nutrition?
**A:** Postpartum meals focus on healing, energy, and (for breastfeeding) milk production. We include anti-inflammatory ingredients, iron-rich foods, easy-to-digest options, and traditional healing foods like bone broth and seaweed soup.

**A:** Yes! Meal delivery is available as a standalone service. No need to book doula or lactation services to enjoy our meals.

## Booking & Scheduling Questions

### Q: How far in advance should I book?
**A:** For guaranteed availability and best doula matching, book during your second trimester (around 20-26 weeks pregnant). However, we can often accommodate last-minute requests within 24-48 hours.

### Q: What happens if I go into labor early?
**A:** Don't worry! We maintain flexible scheduling. Simply call us when baby arrives, and we'll begin services when you're ready - whether that's immediately after hospital discharge or a few days later.

### Q: Can I change my package after booking?
**A:** Yes! Life with a newborn is unpredictable. You can upgrade packages, add hours, or extend services anytime. We prorate and adjust billing accordingly.

### Q: Do you provide services on weekends and holidays?
**A:** Yes! Babies don't follow a 9-5 schedule, and neither do we. Weekend and holiday services available at standard rates (no premium charges). Overnight care available every night.

### Q: How are shifts scheduled?
**A:** After booking, your care coordinator works with you to create a schedule that fits your needs. Want mornings? Evenings? Overnight? Inconsistent days? We're flexible and adjust as your needs change.
