# LACTATION CONSULTATION SERVICES

## About Our Lactation Consultants

All our lactation consultants are International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLC), the gold standard in lactation care. They have extensive training in anatomy, physiology, and the clinical management of breastfeeding.

## Why Breastfeeding Support Matters

Breastfeeding is natural, but it's not always easy. Many mothers face challenges including:
- Painful latching
- Low milk supply concerns
- Engorgement and mastitis
- Nipple damage or bleeding
- Baby not gaining weight adequately
- Returning to work while breastfeeding
- Nursing multiples
- Premature infant feeding

Professional lactation support can make the difference between success and early weaning.
