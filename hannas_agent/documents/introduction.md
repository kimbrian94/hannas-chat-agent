# Hanna’s Postpartum Care

Hanna's Mom Care offers an **In-Home Korean postpartum care service**. A postpartum doula, assigned based on your delivery date, will visit your home to assist with various areas such as meal preparation, chores, and newborn care, helping you and your family have a more comfortable and prepared first few weeks with your baby. Hanna’s Moms Care is the first Korean postpartum care centre to provide “In-Home” care services in North America, established in 2009.


## Puerperal Period

The first 6 weeks after childbirth is called the **puerperal period**. The puerperal period determines 90% of the entire postpartum recovery and mothers need to rest and take care of their health during this period. Particularly, the first 3 weeks of postpartum are emphasized because mothers are both physically and mentally vulnerable. Typically in South Korea, mothers stay in the hospital for 1 week and transition to a postpartum retreat facility for the next 2 weeks.

## In-Home Services

In-home services are provided by our caring, compassionate doulas with years of experience and who have completed internal training and field placements.

## Hanna’s Special Postpartum Massage Therapy

Hanna’s Special Postpartum Massage Therapy is a Korean acupuncture-based full-body massage. Our postpartum massage therapy targets the puerperal period (6~8 weeks to 3 months after delivery), where the relaxin hormone still remains. Our special postpartum massage therapy aims to recover the bones that had gotten stretched out gradually during the 10 months of pregnancy and the ribs, pubic bones, pelvic bones, and rectus abdominis muscle that drastically stretched out during delivery as fast as possible. It is also important to close the opened pelvic bones and rectus abdominis muscle using postpartum massage therapy.

Postpartum massage therapy is crucial for fast recovery as it aims to recover your body that changed due to pregnancy and delivery back to your pre-pregnancy body. We provide customized care based on individual needs. This includes focusing on reducing swelling, supporting blood circulation, pain relief, and beyond. We keep monitoring our clients’ physical health to adjust the massage therapy plan accordingly.

For facial massage, we target 37 energy points on the face that support reducing swelling and recovering skin elasticity. It is the most effective when combined with the full-body massage. Our facial massage aims to reduce swelling and tone the face shape using acupuncture-based massage. Proven by numerous customer reviews, receiving full-body massage together with facial massage is effective in swelling and pain relief.
