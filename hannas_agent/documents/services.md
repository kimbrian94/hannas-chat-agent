## About Our Postpartum Care Philosophy

### The Puerperal Period

The first 6 weeks after childbirth is called the **puerperal period**. This period determines 90% of the entire postpartum recovery, and mothers need to rest and take care of their health during this time. Particularly, the first 3 weeks of postpartum are emphasized because mothers are both physically and mentally vulnerable.

Typically in South Korea, mothers stay in the hospital for 1 week and transition to a postpartum retreat facility for the next 2 weeks. Hanna's Mom's Care brings this traditional Korean postpartum care approach to your home in North America.

### Our Experience

Hanna's Moms Care is the **first Korean postpartum care centre to provide "In-Home" care services in North America**, established in 2009. Our caring, compassionate doulas have years of experience and have completed internal training and field placements to ensure the highest quality of care for your family.
